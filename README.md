# pytorch-probot

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that Bot actions for PyTorch

Add an issue to your project like https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/24422
and add a `.github/pytorch-probot.yml` file with:

```yml
tracking_issue: 24422
```

Based on who is listed in the tracking issue, the bot will automatically
CC people when labels are added to an issue.

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run the tests
yarn test

# Run the bot
yarn start
```

## Live testing as a GitHub App

If you want to smoketest the bot on a test repository, you'll need to
create a GitHub app.  Go to the webpage from probot; it will walk
through the process.

## Deploying GitHub Actions

Although a GitHub App is convenient for testing, it requires an actual
server to deploy in prod.  Previously we ran the server on AWS, but this
deployment process was substantially more involved.  GitHub Actions
deployment is simpler.  Follow the instructions at
https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md

## (DEFUNCT) Deploying to AWS

Previously we deployed this bot to AWS Lambda.  We now deploy it with
GitHub Actions.  However, these instructions might be useful if we need
a lower latency version of the bot.

```sh
zip -FSr ../pytorch-probot.zip . -x '*.git*' '*.env*'
s3cmd put ../pytorch-probot.zip s3://ossci-assets/pytorch-probot.zip
```

Then "Upload a file from Amazon S3" from the web UI at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions/pytorch-probot?tab=graph (using the above s3 url)
